# OptiHack5070
Dell Optiplex 5070 Hackintosh OpenCore

My efforts to get an Optiplex 5070 fully working using Opecore bootloader. Included is the entire package, with SSDTime dumps.

Currently working:

I think everything, but sleep.


Not working:

Just Sleep, it always kernel panics at 180seconds. 

Things to do, besides get sleep working: 

Disable CGF lock in the bios
Allocating addotional preset ram for the iGPU
Verify xchi handoff is actually happening
